Thank you for asking. I just got to know from my colleague ma'am that there was a schedule change on your flight Reservation due to which now the return flight the one leaving out of Mexico City gives you a layover for more than More than 12 hours in Mexico City due to which you are looking for an alternate option\n[00:04:55.00 --> 00:05:02.00][Agent_2] Okay, no worries, ma'am, sure, I will just take a look on your reservation and will try to assess you with my level best, okay? Please allow me some time. [Overlap Found]\n[00:05:06.00 --> 00:05:11.00][Agent_2] Let me just try to see what else I do have available for you for October Correct.\n[00:05:15.00 --> 00:05:17.00][Agent_2] to Boston so basically it's\n[00:05:23.00 --> 00:05:25.00][Agent_2] Okay, it's Mexico Mazatlan\n[00:05:27.00 --> 00:05:29.00][Customer] Yes, Mazatlan, Mexico, Tabarro.\n[00:06:16.00 --> 00:06:18.00][Agent_2] Allow me some time now, it's taking me a bit long.\n[00:06:48.00 --> 00:07:29.00][Agent_2] Okay, ma'am, there is a flight departing from, departing from Mexico City, the option I do have available, it's departing from Mazatlan at 1125 AM, arriving Mexico City by 215 PM, then from Mexico City departing at 310 PM, arriving Salt Lake City at 730 PM, then from Salt Lake City departing at 1159 PM, and arriving Boston Logan, Massachusetts, the next day by 640 AM. Would this work?\n[00:07:30.00 --> 00:07:37.00][Customer] No, I don't need to go to Salt Lake City. That's the other side of the country.\n[00:07:39.00 --> 00:07:56.00][Agent_2] I can understand that, ma'am, but rather than going to Atlanta, I'm offering you a flight to Salt Lake City and then from Salt Lake City to Boston, Logan, DC.\n[00:07:58.00 --> 00:08:01.00][Customer] No, that's not saving me much time.\n[00:08:03.00 --> 00:08:16.00][Agent_2] Then I do also have a flight leaving at 5 15 p.m. Okay, but this one would give you a long layover, ma'am, then. It will be a layover of almost around 12 hours in\n[00:08:22.00 --> 00:08:24.00][Agent_2] Are you flexible with the dates?\n[00:08:25.00 --> 00:08:26.00][Speaker_04] No.\n[00:08:34.00 --> 00:08:45.00][Customer] You know, I want to leave early in the morning on the 13th and I'd like to get into Boston late on the 13th or very early on the 14th.\n[00:09:22.00 --> 00:09:24.00][Agent_2] No worries, man. We'll just try to see what else I\n[00:09:26.00 --> 00:09:27.00][Customer] OK.\n[00:09:43.00 --> 00:09:53.00][Agent_2] So, ma'am, upon checking, it seems that the only option is either by going to Salt Lake City, going through Salt Lake City or a flight with 12 hours layover in...\n[00:09:55.00 --> 00:10:07.00][Customer] Okay, well, can we change airlines then? Because there's a American Airlines flight from Mazatlan leaving at 1119 a.m. getting into Boston at 952 p.m.\n[00:10:08.00 --> 00:10:13.00][Agent_2] Ma'am, if that's the case, then we can only process a refund for you on this [Overlap Found]\n[00:10:13.00 --> 00:10:14.00][Customer] with one layer.\n[00:10:13.00 --> 00:10:26.00][Agent_2] Tickets, and you can make a new reservation with American Airlines because we can't change the airlines, ma'am. We need to have to follow the carrier rules and we have to rebook you or accommodate you only on the same airline.\n[00:10:37.00 --> 00:10:38.00][Speaker_04] Um,\n[00:10:40.00 --> 00:10:41.00][Customer] How long does the\n[00:10:44.00 --> 00:10:52.00][Agent_2] From the refund time frame which we are supposed to inform our customers about is one to two billing cycles. Okay, that is 30 to 60 days [Overlap Found]\n[00:10:52.00 --> 00:10:54.00][Customer] Billing cycle is at a billing cycle. [Overlap Found]\n[00:10:56.00 --> 00:10:57.00][Agent_2] 30 to 60 days a month.\n[00:10:58.00 --> 00:11:05.00][Customer] Oh my god, so they're gonna keep my $800 and I've got to put out another $800.\n[00:11:06.00 --> 00:11:38.00][Agent_2] Ma'am, that's just the maximum standard time frame I'm letting you know about, okay? Usually, it returns back to the customer's credit card before the time. But just in case, if there is any discrepancy or any issue with the payment or the processor of the payment, any gateway issue, then in that kind of cases, it usually takes longer times, and due to which, we inform our customers that they might get the refund back in the next one to two billing cycles. But it doesn't happen on all the cases.\n[00:11:41.00 --> 00:11:44.00][Customer] Lovely. Isn't that special?\n[00:11:52.00 --> 00:12:02.00][Customer] Well, I'll call back if I need you, because the email says I can cancel it right through the email, so I'll just do that way, probably.\n[00:12:03.00 --> 00:12:08.00][Agent_2] No worries, sure, ma'am, you can do that. Is there anything else apart from this I can\n[00:12:10.00 --> 00:12:11.00][Customer] No, there's not.\n[00:12:12.00 --> 00:12:31.00][Agent_2] Okay, ma'am, if you're all set and before disconnecting the call, it's an humble request from my end that please stay connected for a one-question survey to rate my services. And again, thank you for contacting Us. You were talking to Simon. Have a wonderful day ahead, ma'am. Take care, stay healthy, and buh-bye.
